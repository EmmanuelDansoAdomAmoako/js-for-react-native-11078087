## Task 1: `arrayManipulation.js`

- The `arrayManipulation.js` file contains a function called `processArray`.
- The function takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array where even numbers are squared, and odd numbers are tripled.

## Task 2: `formatArrayStrings` Function
- The `arrayManipulation.js` file also includes a function called `formatArrayStrings`.
- This function modifies an array of strings based on the corresponding processed numbers (from Task 1):
  - Capitalize the string if the number is even.
  - Convert the string to lowercase if the number is odd.

## Task 3: `userInfo.js`

- The `userInfo.js` file contains a function called `createUserProfiles`.
- It takes an array of original names and an array of modified names (from Task 2) and returns an array of user profiles with auto-incremented IDs.
